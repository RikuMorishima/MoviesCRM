Middleware

* What is a middleware?
  - Middleware is the software that is assembled into an app pipeline
    and is used to handle requests and responses.
	Each middleware component, unless configured specifally, can 
	choose to pass the request to the next component in the pipeline and
	can perform work before and after components in the pipeline.
	
	Middleware is processed similar to how a stack data structure works.
	Specifically, when we use a pipeline, we start by preprocessing data
	sent by the user with each middleware component, "putting" the 
	components into a stack. When all components are pushed, the stack
	starts popping the stack and postprocesses the data using popped
	components as the postprocessing code.
	I do want to note that while Middleware is processed similar to a stack,
	it is actually processed using delegates that go after the last delegate 
	insertted into the Middleware components.
